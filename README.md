Pursuit of Intuition is my first website project.  It incorporates html, css and javascript.    

End State: 

Concept: 
  Users who visit the site will be presented with a stylish and interactive presentation of other user's entered photos, each
photo carrying a unique meaning to the owner.  Users may enter into a photo challenge, created by another user and will have a limited
amount of time to provide a short response on what they believe the meaning of the photo is to the user who presented the challenge.
The owner of the photo challenge will review the 50 (limit) registered responses within a 72hr period (limit) and will select the response
(blind to the knowledge of who made the response) which closest resembles what the photo represents as the meaning of their photo.  Once
the owner selects the winning response (potentially top 3 responses), points are allocated to the winners.  The theory is that the leaderboards should reflect those with a higher intuition.

Simple Photo Challenge Example:
  User A uploaded a photo of a child with an ill-favored look upon their face, captured in full sprint in the middle of the photo.  There is a barely visible "Beach" sign in the background with arrow pointing toward the direction that the child is running from.  
  User B clicked the photo submitted by User A as the small portrait appeared to be interesting.  Once the photo was clicked, a high resolution photo appeared on the screen with 10-15 seconds of viewing time, prior to being prompted to accept or decline the challenge (constraint).  
  User B accepted and is undergoing the challenge.  User B reviews the picture and makes a few notes in the textbox provided.  After writing a few of the facts from what they see, the user considers how the owner of the photo might perceive the photo, what meaning does it carry or why they might have added the photo as a challenge.  User B notices that the landscape in the photo appears to be a non operable beach and there is no other people around, but who took the photo?  Was this the owner's personal photo?  Then what would it mean to them?  User B taps into their intuition (or assumed intuition) and enters a response.  
  User A reviews the response and is very delighted and surprised that this response is so close to what the photo means to them:  "The parent is capturing their child's first trip to the beach, of which the child encountered an animal or strange fish that is not normally encountered at a regulated beach.  Don't take your child to an unregulated beach, especially for their first time!!"
  
Continued development of the site will incorporate and expand the site's functionality, while practicing new skills and technologies learned.
